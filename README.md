# Campus Event Platform

A modern, interactive, and role-based platform for managing campus events. This application provides a seamless experience for students to discover and register for events, and for organizers and administrators to manage them effectively. The entire application runs in the browser, using `localStorage` to persist data for a realistic demo experience.

## Key Features

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Three distinct user roles (Student, Organizer, Admin) with tailored permissions.
- **Interactive Event Listings**: Students can browse a list of upcoming events with real-time attendee counts.
- **Seamless Registration**: Students can register for events with a single click, with their registration status updating in real-time.
- **Organizer Dashboard**: Organizers can view registrations for their events, approve or reject pending requests, and manage event details.
- **Powerful Admin Panel**: Admins have full oversight, including:
  - Managing all events (add/delete).
  - Managing all users (add/delete organizers, view all students).
  - Viewing all registrations across the platform.
- **Persistent Data**: Uses the browser's `localStorage` to save all users, events, and registrations, so your data is preserved across sessions.
- **Modern & Responsive UI**: A clean, professional, and mobile-friendly interface built with Tailwind CSS.
